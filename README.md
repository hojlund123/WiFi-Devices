# Work in progress

This code uses the nmap library to scan all hosts on the 192.168.1.0/24 network and print out the IP addresses of all devices that are currently online.

To create a web application in Flask that shows the online devices, you can build a simple HTML page that displays the list of online devices using the Flask framework.
